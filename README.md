# ShoppingCart-CodingTest
The project was a coding challenge build as a part of a recruitment process. The build file is an automated file that compiles and runs the test cases. 

<b>Running the code</b>

First, you need to ensure you have jest installed. We can do so with npm or yarn. To do with npm, run the following 

>[$ npm install jest --save-dev]


Once you have done that, go to the terminal and navigate to the folder where the project is located and run:

>$ npm run test

Once you have run it, you will be able to see the test results in the console.
